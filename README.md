# NR491 - Fall 2022

---

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Natural Resources 491 at NC State University.

Each of these `exercise{X}` folders contain an exercise and homework assignment that we will be working on this semester. Some of the data you will need is provided, other (larger) data will be distributed when you get to that assignment.

You will need the YML file to create your conda environment for this class.

I will update this README if/when I think of interesting things to add.
